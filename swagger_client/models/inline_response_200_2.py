    RepositPower External

    Unofficial RepositPower External API  This API is built by hand from the description at https://api.repositpower.com/docs/  It should not be mistaken for official in any way shape or form, it's simply my attempt to document the API and build some client libraries from that.  This API is demonstrably wrong around authentication - please read the official docco at the link above for accurate details. It will login, but all the login options are not captured - I wasn't clear how to write up both basic and token login being available on all URLs (ie. how to make auth an either/or rather than a both).  This API is also not completed yet. I've not tested a bunch of 200 responses, and some that I have don't have accurate enums in them because I don't know all the possible values.  Also, I haven't quite figured out how to wrap the whole thing in unit tests.  Publishes a swagger file to https://github.com/silarsis/repositpowerswagger and a python client library to https://github.com/silarsis/rp-python-client  This version (1.0.0) matches version 11/03/2016 of the official docs (as at 30/5/2017)
